I made my first website during 3rd year of my diploma engineering. it was plain **XHTML + CSS** website. since then i have enjoyed working on server-side web apps using **PHP, Ajax**; couple of mobile apps for **Android** and few mobile sites using **Jquery Mobile**. 

I have been fortunate to be a part of technical team of my college's annual techfest [FootPrints.](http://www.msu-footprints.org) I worked on Event Registration system, Android app and mobile website for FootPrints.

Presently, i m part of [ Training and Placement cell](http://ftemsu-placements.org/) of my college and maintaining placement portal.
