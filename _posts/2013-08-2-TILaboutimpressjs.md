As i have promised in aprevious post, i'd be posting new thing a day which i have learnt or came across that day.

so here's today's thing: **impress.js**

so, how do you make your presentations? Microsoft Powerpoint right?
i m sure very few of you use different tools than MS Powerpoint. but, it'a boring!
i came across a tool called "Prezi" when i was in my final year of diploma. i was searching about "How to make amazing presentations?" and google led me to Prezi.

Today we were discussing about presentations and one friend tossed the term "impress.js"
it is HTML+CSS3 based tool(rather say framework) that let you create presentations like Prezi. but, with a added feature 3D(that is what they says).

here is an online [demo](http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js/#/overview) of impress.js


Adios!
