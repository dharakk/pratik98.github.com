As i have promised in my previous post, i'd be posting new thing a day which i have learnt or came across that day.

so here's today's thing: **[impress.js][impress.js]**

so, how do you make your presentations? Microsoft Powerpoint right?
i m sure very few of you use different tools than MS Powerpoint. but, it's boring!
i came across a tool called "[Prezi][Prezi]" when i was in my final year of diploma. i was searching about "How to make amazing presentations?" and google led me to [Prezi][Prezi].

Today we were discussing about presentations and one friend tossed the term "[impress.js][impress.js]"
it is **HTML5+CSS3** based tool(rather say framework) that let you create presentations like [Prezi][Prezi]. but, with a added feature 3D(that is what they says).

here is an online [demo](http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js/#/overview) of impress.js


Adios!
