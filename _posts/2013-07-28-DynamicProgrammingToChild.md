How Should you explain dynamic Programming to 4 year old?
=========================================================
*writes down "1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 =" on a sheet of paper*<br/>
"What's that equal to?"<br/>
*counting* "Eight!"<br/>
*writes down another "1+" on the left*<br/>
"What about that?"<br/>
*quickly* "Nine!"<br/>
"How'd you know it was nine so fast?"<br/>
"You just added one more"<br/>
"So you didn't need to recount because you remembered there were eight! Dynamic Programming is just a fancy way to say 'remembering stuff to save time later'"<br/><br/>
