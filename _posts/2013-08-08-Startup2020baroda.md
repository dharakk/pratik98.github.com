I recently attended 3 day startup event(possibly the first one at baroda). we had a team and an idea. we worked hard to tranformed it into business model and prototype throughout the event.
we didn't win the competition but it was a nice learning experiance for me.:)

so here is the fine points of what i learned from the event,

* Entrepreneurship is not EASY.
* Business Model is very important.
* you must have faith in your idea.
* *"jitne muh utni baten!"* listen to people and learn from them but don't let their opinion affect ur idea.
* winning is important. it will make you feel happy and proud. but you can't win everytime. so chill!  
* meet (new) people. 
* attend startup events.
* believe, believe, believe.
* Hardwork isn't the only key,work smartly. 

Adios!
