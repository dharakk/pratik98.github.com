blogging has always been a passion for me. and i have tried to blog now and then. if you have followed this blog, in the begining i have mentioned about writing more technical stuff here.but let me tell you one thing, technical blogging requires much more time. there is no point in writing half-baked articles. they serve no purpose. 

lately, i ain't getting much time to blog. i feel bad. so i have decided to post some interesting things (Tech/Non Tech.) which i come across during daytime. I'd be calling it **TIL Series**

Starting from today.

PS: i am lazzy and wikipedia does good job!

Adios!
